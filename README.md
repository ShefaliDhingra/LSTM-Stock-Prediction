# ðŸ“ˆ LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network** to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model processes past stock price trends and forecasts future values using deep learning techniques.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Uses **LSTM** for time series forecasting  
- Predicts stock prices based on historical closing values  
- Data preprocessing includes **scaling, splitting, and reshaping**  
- Evaluates model performance using **MSE and loss curves**  
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing actual vs. predicted prices  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- **NumPy & Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- **scikit-learn**  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- The model successfully captures stock price trends but faces challenges with extreme fluctuations.  
- Visualizations show a close match between **actual and predicted values**, indicating effective learning.  

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LSTM-Stock-Prediction.git
